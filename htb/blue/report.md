# Bug Bounty Report

## Target
- IP Address: 10.10.10.40

## Vulnerability Details

### Bug Description
The target system running Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 is vulnerable to the MS17-010 EternalBlue exploit, which allows unauthorized access to the user shell. This vulnerability is documented in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010).

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Scan the target IP address using `nmap -sC -sV -A 10.10.10.40`.
2. Initiate Metasploit with the following commands:
   - `msfdb init`
   - `msfconsole`
3. Utilize Metasploit modules and exploits:
   - `auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command`
   - `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010`
   - `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

### Expected Behavior
The target system should not be vulnerable to the MS17-010 EternalBlue exploit, and unauthorized access to the user shell should not be possible.

### Actual Behavior
Using both the Metasploit auxiliary modules and the exploit, unauthorized access to the user shell is achieved. This indicates a security vulnerability on the target system.

### Vulnerability Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the target system's user shell. This could lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities.

### Proof of Concept
A successful proof of concept has been demonstrated by accessing the user shell on the target system using the MS17-010 EternalBlue exploit.

## Affected Components
- Operating System: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
- Affected Services: Microsoft Windows RPC, Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn, and others.

## Recommendations
1. The target system should be immediately patched and updated to address the MS17-010 vulnerability. Applying the latest security updates is crucial.
2. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management should be conducted to prevent similar security issues in the future.
3. Review and enhance network security configurations to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

## Additional Information
- The vulnerability has been documented in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010.
- The target system is running Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1.
